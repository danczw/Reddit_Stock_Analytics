if it goes up you would either need to pay it back with other cash since ""never sell"" or liquidate position anyway and eventually pay cap gains at whatever % it is in future.

1: one directional risk being tsla goes up you win, down you lose and actually owe the money back if it goes down. 
2: if you invested this in a fixed income position at 1.9 million you would generate 50,000 a year forever in bond market for free. you could sell a very long term almost 100% itm call to extract the cash. wont be realized until years out and then the fixed income would hedge against gains. youd have cap gains tax and a few hundred k to toss at taxes.

what hole in your life is there that $1.8 million would not fill? you invested $150k, and held on for a while, so i'm guessing you're not exactly poor...you probably have a steady job with decent income, or inherited some money that you were comfortable enough to yolo a while ago. 

$1.8 million, even if you just kept pace at inflation in a conservative investing account, is enough for $45k/year (equivalent) for forty years. you'd be almost 70, and have a lifetime of earning and investing elsewhere to become rich beyond your wildest dreams... but that $1.8 million would guarantee you and your family would never starve.

you could take risks, start a business, move to a foreign country without much of a plan, or even play video games and travel for the rest of your life and relax. you could pay for generations to go to college, or to have family visit you every christmas. you could be the kindly uncle or neighbor who pays for the braces of a kid down the street. that money can make your life, and the lives of those around you better, but only if you're willing to spend it.

you're already a millionaire. will the chance of maybe becoming a billionaire fill the hole in your heart? you won't become the world's first trillionaire by holding a small amount of one stock. money is not its own good, and the nihilistic collection of it independent of its ability to do good is the same vampiric mindset that justifies gambling away a great gift for the possibility of *maybe* someday having more. ask yourself what good $1.8 million can do, and what harm would come if you lost it.",1

- when the market goes way up, this doesn't go up nearly as much. this sucks particularly during a big dip then growth
- if the underlying asset (nasdaq 100) goes down, so do your dividends

tesla doesn't even make $1 billion a year. they are not a $1 trillion company. would you pay $1 million for a company that profits $1,000 a year? that is the exact math here. 

there are likely 1000s of companies that make way beyond $1 billion (in a quarter not an entire year) and they have nowhere near that kind of valuation. 

gm/ford combined (just for the last quarter) profited $5 to $6 billion on $70 billion in sales in 3 months. their combined valuation is $95 billion. 

tesla squeaked by with $300 million in quarterly profit on $9 billion in sales (likely 125k rich people buying 70k cars). their valuation is $830 billion. 

$300 million profit (tsla) vs. $6 billion profit (gm+f).
$9 billion sales (tsla) vs. $70 billion sales (gm+f).
$1 trillion valuation (tsla) vs. $90 billion valuation (gm+f).

something doesn't add up but feel free to go hunt for a company that makes $1,000 profit in a year and offer to buy them out for $1,000,000. that's what is going on with tesla right now. 

it could be that, ""but, but, but, they'll change the world, everyone will worship tesla and buy one, and but, but, everything will be tesla, so the valuation makes sense....cause years from now everything will be tesla"". 

yes, it could be, but right now the reality is you are walking up to a lemonade stand on a hot summer day and offering an 8 year old 1 million dollars to own the lemonade stand. (i know not the best analogy but profits to valuation it is actually quite accurate).",6

i’m a fan of nio and own the stock, but i don’t think people realize that having higher resolution cameras (and similar upsized tech) only increases cost without actually improving performance (and you need to increase your other tech to deal with higher data volumes). autonomy just needs to be vastly superior to human drivers and ubiquitous for a successful taas solution; a low cost approach via tesla is much more likely to succeed broadly since the sensor suite is already vastly better than any human or group of humans. nio may have useful niche applications in certain cities, but likely won’t be the broadly accepted approach (similar to waymo and cruise).

beyond that, you're relying on chinese accounting, which is utterly unverified and repeatedly scammy. 

and thats just the issues with it being chinese. even if we assume it isn't chinese, its a shit investment.

first of all, electric vehicles are valued in a manner that is nonsense. electric vehicles are already commonplace and the largest ev manufacturers are going to be the largest auto manufacturers. 

people here think that nio is poised for self driving, but daimler already has mass produced semis that are as self-driving as is legal, and tesla has passenger vehicles that are already as self-driving as is legal. those two companies are going to be gathering data at a rate that nio simply won't be able to do, which means nio can't properly inform their machine learning algorithms for years after them. 

and then, even if they did do that, the valuation is *still* nonsense, because **the entire car industry just isn't that big**. nio right now has a market cap of almost 100 billion existing as a total scam shell company. how much higher do you think it will fucking go? it's already bigger than daimler. do you think it will be bigger than toyota? fucking seriously? with the track record of toyota's management, you actually expect this shit chinese scam to overtake them?

well, even if they do, it'll go up less than zoom went up since march. is that really even a good investment? how long do you think it will take for nio to overtake toyota? 5 years? 10? you want a 300% return to take you 10 years?

i don’t have any stop losses set up either, but it’s a good idea to have them for stocks you may not plan on holding for the long term. however, all stocks have their ups and downs, so if you are planning on holding a stock for a very long time/forever, probably no need for stop loss. just depends on where you are financially, what your strategy is, etc. i have panic sold stocks that a day prior i would’ve said i’m holding forever. it’s wise to go in with a plan, even write it down, so you can stick to your guns based on research you have done. in the heat of the moment, you might forget everything you initially studied about that stock. on some of my panic sells when a stock starts dropping all of a sudden that i had planned on holding a long time because it’s long term prospects did and still do look excellent, i have left tens of thousands of dollars on the table because after the dip, it went right back up and in some cases soared within a day or two after the dip. and this can happen even on good news. buy the rumor, sell the news they say.

battery swap. what a terrible idea. 

the more cars nio sells, the more batteries they have to set aside. tesla doesn't have enough batteries for their cars so they are investing and building in their own battery factory. meanwhile nio has to set aside a high number (20%? 35%?) of expensive depreciating battery packs instead of these packs going into cars. 

oh, did they say it takes 5 minute for a swap? sure if no one is ahead of you. it seems it's very common there are 3-4 cars in front of you and you need to wait 25 minutes until you are done. might as well just go for supercharging then. 

one more thing. you are allowed 6 swaps per year? what happened when it's august and you did the 6th swap, only to realize the current battery pack is degraded and only has 80% battery capacity on your new car? you have to wait until next year to swap and pray for a better battery. 

nio will do ok in the future. but for a car company that doesn't have its own car factory, it won't grow anywhere close to tesla's size. if people are jumping into nio ($70b valuation) after watching this event, then tsla ($800b) is truly undervalued.",-7

nio will get there and i’m rooting for them, but tesla is still apple (especially in the early days of iphone) and nio is playing catch up with android-like hw. nowadays some android devices beat apple at their game, but it took years and both have learned from each other.

lot of current apple and non-apple investors think apple is a ""one trick pony"" with the iphone.  i've said this many times, but companies like apple, google, amazon, microsoft, etc have a huge cash war chest to enter new markets pretty much anytime they desire to do so.  to me this helps justify their current market cap.

personally, i think apple silicon is going to be the ""trojan horse"" that allows them to enter new markets.  when i saw nio's announcement on their partnership with nvidia and details around the new system for autonomous driving, my first reaction was a question as to what sort of power consumption will be required to run their system.  as a long time personal nvidia user, controlling power consumption hasn't been nvidia's biggest strength.  think what autonomous systems powered by apple silicon and software can do in this segment.

not sure if the report on the hyundai/apple partnership is true, but i'm glad apple is not building their own car.  most likely they will provide the infotainment and autonomous driving solutions to other car manufacturers to incorporate into their cars.  ""powered by apple"" or ""apple inside"" sort of speak.

a great margin by car manufacturers would be around 20%, but apple is already achieving 40% margin on the iphones.  i think just providing the infotainment/autonomous driving system will allow apple to keep margins closer to 40%.

i could see people saying ""i drive an apple car"" instead of ""i drive a hyundai"" which will increase apple's branding.

nio is absurdly volatile for months now, popular stocks are not neccaricly actually volatile, i am holding another chinese stock that is my best total capital gain last year and this year and when nio went down -5% instantly when the riots happened, my stock just stod still, it did not falter at all on those news. that is a stock that went up more %+ this week then nio (i believe like 5 or so more) and never had a negative streak or a sell of at all. that is something that really scares me and why i read these kinda places. of course everything has a risk/reward balance etc. but people seem to sell of nio as soon as anything happens, while people here seem to believe that is normal for a ""growth stock"" which it actually is not, its popular for a memestock, u can have growth without having the absurd trader behavior.",2
